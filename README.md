Disease Prediction System

Introduction

The Disease Prediction System is an AI-powered application designed to predict potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input symptoms and generate accurate predictions, along with relevant medical information such as disease descriptions, medications, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle suggestions.

Features

Symptom-Based Prediction: Uses supervised learning models to predict diseases from user symptoms.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes symptom inputs for consistency.

Comprehensive Output: Provides disease descriptions, precautions, medications, and lifestyle recommendations.

User-Friendly Interface: Allows users to input symptoms easily and receive instant results.

Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask (if applicable)

Machine Learning Model: Random Forest, Decision Tree, or other classifiers
